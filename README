This program is a simple game in which the players each take turns rolling a virtual die. The scores and healths of the players are determined based on the roll of the die and which treasures they find. Each player keeps collecting treasures each round and can either gain or lose points based on the roll of the die. When you decide the game is over the stats are all listed out at the bottom.
